# Examples of my work

## Tuitionn

**Tuitionn** was a free GCSE revision website I began working on while I was in Year 10 (age 14).

It was programmed in **PHP**, **HTML,** **CSS** and **JavaScript**. It also used Material Design.

It focused on providing a free, accurate experience for UK students to help them study for their end of school exams. It was used by most of my school year and helped many of us achieve greater grades than what we could've done without it.
