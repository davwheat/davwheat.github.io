## RevisR

**[RevisR](https://github.com/davwheat/RevisR)** was the prequel version of Tuitionn for Android, coded in .NET Xaramin (C#). It was scrapped after 2 months of work. Most information from the app was ported to Tuitionn

## PoliceAnimations

**[PoliceAnimations](https://github.com/davwheat/PoliceAnimations)** was a Lua script for a version of Grand Theft Auto V Multiplayer called FiveM or FiveReborn. It added a variety of police related animations to the game including a 'surrender and get on your knees' pose and a 'hand on radio' pose.

## TrainerVConfigCreator

**[TrainerVConfigCreator](https://github.com/davwheat/TrainerVConfigCreator)** is a C# WinForms application

## gcse-computing

**[gcse-computing](https://github.com/davwheat/gcse-computing)** is a collection of Python files that each do different things. For example there is a Chat Bot, Binary > Decimal converter, Mad Libs and more.
